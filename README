 - The eighth deadly sin is: to implement Bukkit & Spigot on top of Sponge.

 - How so? 

 - Put in this way, Bukkit cares about backward compatibility. Therefore it cannot drop deprecated 
   things on the fly. While sure SpongeAPI strictly uses SemVer, it is still in *beta* so who the 
   hell knows what will be there in the next bump of major version.
   Also, they don't share the same design philosophy. Think about `DataManipolator`: does Bukkit 
   has that sort of thing?
   
   Ideally, SpongeAPI would replace Bukkit in the unforeseenable future, but we all knows that it 
   would NOT be true in next six months.

 - So what's the deal?
   
   There has been attempts on implementing Bukkit on top of SpongeAPI, but they are discontinued.
   And now you are about to kickstart this drama again.

 - No, I am not going to kickstart this drama. I want to witness the history.
   We have seen the course of history of Minecraft. Risugami. MCPC, I mean the one without "plus".
   Fall of CraftBukkit. Spongie's struggle. 
   Those awesome and diligent people have overcome so many challenges. But generally speaking -

   History is fading.
      People joining.
      People leaving.
   ...

 - Left everything?

 - ...  Paralyzing. I want to to see what history will choose. And kickstart the progression when 
   necessary.

 - I see. Farewell, the witness in the dark. New year is almost here.

 - Yeah. New year. The promised day. Farewell, my counterpart from the shadow.
